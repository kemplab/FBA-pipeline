0.0003	ATP	7	ZKHQWZAMYRWXGA-KQYNXXCUSA-N				ATPase activity is decreased in simultaneous presence of 1 mM of substrates of forward and reverse NAMPT reaction
0.00183	ATP	7	ZKHQWZAMYRWXGA-KQYNXXCUSA-N				ATPase (ATP hydrolysis) activity of the free NAMPT, 2 mM ATP
0.00617	ATP	7	ZKHQWZAMYRWXGA-KQYNXXCUSA-N				ATPase activity is enhanced in presence of 1 mM nicotinamide, 2 mM ATP
0.015	ATP	7	ZKHQWZAMYRWXGA-KQYNXXCUSA-N				ADP-ATP radiolabel exchange in absence of other reactants (without NMN synthesis), formation or hydrolysis of phospho-NAMPT may be rate limiting for overall NMN synthesis reaction in presence of ATP
0.0183	ATP	7	ZKHQWZAMYRWXGA-KQYNXXCUSA-N				ATPase activity is enhanced in presence of 1 mM diphosphate, presence of PRPP and/or nicotinamide reverses stimulation by diphosphate, 2 mM ATP
