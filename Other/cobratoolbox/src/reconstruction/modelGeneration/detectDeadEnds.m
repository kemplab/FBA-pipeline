function mets = detectDeadEnds(model, removeExternalMets)
% Returns a list of indices of metabolites which either participate in only
% one reaction or can only be produced or consumed (i.e. all reactions involving
% the metabolite either only produce or only consume it, respecting the reaction lower and upper bounds).
%
% USAGE:
%
%    outputMets = detectDeadEnds(model, removeExternalMets)
%
% INPUT:
%    model:                 COBRA model structure
%
% OPTIONAL INPUT:
%    removeExternalMets:    Dont return metabolites that participate in reactions of the following type:
%                           "A <=>/-> " or " <=>/-> A" or exclusively present in
%                           inconsistent reactions as defined in `Gevorgyan et al, Bioinformatics, 2008`
%
% OUTPUT:
%    outputMets:            List of indicies of metabolites which can ether
%                           only be produced or consumed.
