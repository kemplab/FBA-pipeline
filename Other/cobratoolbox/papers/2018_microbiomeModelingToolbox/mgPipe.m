%MgPipe is a MATLAB based pipeline to integrate microbial abundances 
%(coming from metagenomic data) with constraint based modeling, creating 
%individuals' personalized models.
%The pipeline is divided in 3 parts:
%[PART 1] Analysis of individuals' specific microbes abundances are computed.
%[PART 2]: 1 Constructing a global metabolic model (setup) containing all the 
%microbes listed in the study. 2 Building individuals' specific models 
%integrating abundance data retrieved from metagenomics. For each organism,
%reactions are coupled to the objective function.
%[PART 3] Simulations under different diet regimes.
%MgPipe was created (and tested) for AGORA 1.0 please first download AGORA 
%version 1.0 from https://vmh.uni.lu/#downloadview and place the mat files 
%into a folder.
