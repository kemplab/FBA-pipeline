Title : gaimc : Graph Algorithms In Matlab Code
Summary (100 chars) :
Efficient pure-Matlab implementations of graph algorithms to complement MatlabBGL's mex functions.
Description (5000 chars) :

While MatlabBGL uses the Boost Graph Library for efficient graph routines,
gaimc implements everything in pure Matlab code.  While the routines are 
slower, they aren't as slow as I initially thought.  Since people often
have problems getting MatlabBGL to compile on new versions of Matlab
or on new architectures, this library is then a complement to MatlabBGL.

See the published M-files for a few examples of the capabilities.

Functions
  depth first search (dfs) 
  breadth first search (bfs)
  connected components (scomponents)
  maximum weight bipartite matching (bipartite_matching)
  Dijkstra's shortest paths (dijkstra)
  Prim's minimum spanning tree (mst_prim)
  clustering coefficients (clustercoeffs)
  directed clustering coefficients (dirclustercoeffs)
  core numbers (corenums)
